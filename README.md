Tomo Pendant Firmware (ESP32-S3)

![ESP32-S3 Firmware Build](https://github.com/autonomusco/tomopendantfirmware/actions/workflows/esp32s3-build.yml/badge.svg)

The **Tomo Pendant** is a wearable safety and companionship device designed for elder care.  
This firmware runs on the **ESP32-S3** microcontroller and enables:  

- üîó BLE connectivity with the caregiver mobile app  
- üß≠ Fall detection using the **MPU6050** accelerometer/gyro  
- üîã Battery monitoring with the **MAX17048** fuel gauge  
- üÜò Emergency button input and alert pipeline  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud API hooks for caregiver notifications  
- üîÑ OTA update framework for secure upgrades  
- üéô Voice trigger and audio hooks for future features  
- üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Health sensor integration (HR/SpO‚ÇÇ/temp) planned for later

Developer Guide

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd tomo-pendant-firmware
```

2. Set Up ESP-IDF (v5.2.1, ESP32-S3)
```bash
git clone -b v5.2.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git ~/esp-idf
cd ~/esp-idf
./install.sh esp32s3
. ~/esp-idf/export.sh
```
> Run `. ~/esp-idf/export.sh` **in every new terminal session** before building.

3. Build the Firmware
```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
```

### 4. Flash the Device
Connect the ESP32-S3 via USB, then:
```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```
(Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your serial port, e.g., `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` on macOS.)*  
Press **Ctrl+]** to exit the monitor.

5. CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Every push to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions build.  
- Build artifacts (`.bin`, `.elf`) are downloadable from the **Actions tab**.  
- Each artifact is tagged with the commit SHA for traceability.

Next Steps for Development
- Implement fall detection algorithm (threshold + orientation logic).  
- Complete MAX17048 driver integration.  
- Add OTA update logic.  
- Implement BLE GATT services for event uplink.  
- Test battery life under sleep/wake cycles.  
- Extend hooks for health sensors and voice triggers.  


Developer Notes
- All modules are scaffolded with `TODO` placeholders but compile cleanly.  
- Contractors must **implement inside existing `.c/.h` stubs** without changing repo structure.  
- CI builds must stay green ‚Äî do not merge code that breaks `idf.py build`.  
- Hardware pins can be updated in `i2c_bus.c` if wiring changes.  
- Keep all commits small and traceable. Each feature branch should map to a Jira/Notion task.  
- Use GitHub Actions artifacts for testing before flashing hardware.  
- Document any new external components or libraries in `/docs`.  

Contribution Workflow
1. Create a feature branch.  
2. Implement and test locally.  
3. Push branch and open a Pull Request.  
4. Ensure GitHub Actions build passes.  
5. Request review and merge.  

Commit directly to main.
